                           SYLLABUS 
==================================================================

>>> initiation into the impossible <<<

you enter not a class, but a passage. the weeks 
ahead are not numbered, they are marked. each one is a 
chamber: threshold, fragment, paradox, machine, form, gate, seal. 

you will spend 10–14 hours each week inside these chambers.  
sometimes coaxing, sometimes breaking, always listening.  
the tools are humble, simple guis, editors, prompts,  
yet what they open is not.  

by the end you will hold one relic that should not exist.  
an artifact impossible, undeniable.  
together, these relics become the codex,  
a grimoire stitched from contradictions.

  - shape chance with intention

------------------------------------------------------------------
SESSION 5 — GIVEN FORM
(theme: conjuration | tool: blender)
